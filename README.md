# XGBoost-for-DFS-NBA
Tutorial for simple XGBoost regression model.


This is 1 of 2 tutorials that will go into using XGBoost for regression. The first tutorial is very basic and the idea is to get a model set up very quickly, which is why this one is in R and not python as some people have more trouble with python when first starting out. 

The 2nd tutorial will be going into fine tuning parameters and feature selection.
